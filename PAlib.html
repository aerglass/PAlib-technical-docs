	<h1> What the hell is even PAlib </h1>
	<p>PAlib was a wrapper for libnds code, created in 2005 it became extremelly popular because of it easy of use, even a begineer could use it without help. Unfortuonaly PAlib was badly designed, leading to weird errors and incompatibilities to almost everything that it used, even libnds. It does not longer work ever since 2011 lol</p>
	
	Update: Running PAlib on modern devkitARM is possible and it has been proven by me. ASlib is near fucking impossible to run due to it's weird nature of ARM7+ARM9 and the IPC stuff.
	Also the default ARM7 core on PAlib while can work if you use the elf binary it does not support the keys that ARM7 manages (example: touchscreen) https://github.com/AerGlass/palib
